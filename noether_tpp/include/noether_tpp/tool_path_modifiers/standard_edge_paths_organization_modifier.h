 * @brief Organizes a set of tool paths into a standard configuration for edge paths

 * possible to the end of the previous segment. The first segment is chosen as the one whose first waypoint is closest
 * to a reference position. Tool path segments are ordered in the top-level container in order of length, from longest
 * to shortest. Note: waypoints are expected to be ordered correctly on input to the modifier
